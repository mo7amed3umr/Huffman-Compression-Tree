Magnetic fluids used in MDT systems must be biodegradable and nontoxic.
They should have strong magnetic polarization and must maintain colloidal
stability in biological systems. Recent developments in the synthesis of biocompatible ferrofluids have successfully addressed most of these material issues.
Development in MDT design, therefore, needs systematic characterization of
the ferrofluid (and the bonded chemotherapeutic agent) transport phenomena
in the host body fluid flow.
The diffusion of a ferrofluid drop into the host liquid influences the release
of the drug contained within it. Our objective is to visualize and characterize
the magnetically induced accumulation of ferrofluid at a target location and
its subsequent dispersion in a steady host fluid flow. Although the blood or
other biological fluid flow occur in a pulsatile mode, a steady flow analysis
can reveal the basic interaction between magnetic and fluid shear forces and it
provides important information about fluid transport. A numerical simulation is
performed to obtain better insight through mapping the ferrofluid concentration
distribution and mass flux.
